1. Turn xls and xlsx documents into csvs. Try to follow a uniform naming convention so it's obvious what the files are for.

2. Put all of the csv documents into a 'data' folder. Make sure that they are either in subfolders to denote the mineral they are for or that the name makes that clear.

3. Extract the tables from the pdf files and put them into csvs. Be sure they are following the same naming convention and organizational structure as the files from xlsx.

4. If you have time, start to explore the data and make some summary statistics. Maybe get the documentation into a folder (preferably as a .txt file) and work on data dictionaries. 

5. Build a JSON file with data from all of the csv files.
